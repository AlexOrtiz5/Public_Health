# Project objective
  This project embarks on an analytical journey into a public health dataset sourced from Kaggle, specifically from the "Heart Disease Dataset" available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset. The primary objective is to leverage various data science techniques to understand, explore, and ultimately predict the presence of heart disease based on a comprehensive set of patient attributes. Our methodology involves a multi-faceted approach, beginning with rigorous data cleaning to ensure data quality and consistency. Following this, we delve into exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, distributions, and initial relationships within the data through various visualizations. The core of the project then shifts to predictive modeling, where we aim to build robust classification models to accurately identify individuals at risk of heart disease. Furthermore, we will conduct feature importance analysis to pinpoint the most influential factors contributing to the predictions, perform hypothesis testing to statistically validate observed relationships, and explore potential patient segments through unsupervised clustering, all to derive actionable insights from this critical health data.
